# MMU Simulator

📌 Project Overview

The MMU Simulator is an educational project designed to simulate the behavior of a Memory Management Unit (MMU) in an operating system. The simulator helps visualize and understand concepts such as:
	•	Logical to physical address translation
	•	Paging and page tables
	•	Page size and frame allocation
	•	Address offset calculations
	•	Memory access flow

This project is intended for learning, demonstration, and academic purposes, particularly for students studying Operating Systems or Computer Architecture.
