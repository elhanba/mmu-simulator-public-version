# MMU Simulator (https://mmu-simulator-ruddy.vercel.app/)

📌 Project Overview

The MMU Simulator is an educational project designed to simulate the behavior of a Memory Management Unit (MMU) in an operating system. The simulator helps visualize and understand concepts such as:
- Logical to physical address translation
- Paging and page tables
- Page size and frame allocation
- Address offset calculations
- Memory access flow

This project is intended for learning, demonstration, and academic purposes, particularly for students studying Operating Systems or Computer Architecture.
